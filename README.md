# GRAPE PLANT_DISEASE_IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION

A deep learning-based project to classify plant diseases using leaf images of grape plants. This project aims to assist farmers and agriculturists by providing an AI-powered tool to detect diseases in grape vines at an early stage.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can classify grape plant diseases from leaf images and deploy the solution via a simple, user-friendly GUI.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
Python
TensorFlow & Keras
OpenCV
StreamLit (for GUI and deployment)

ðŸ—‚ Dataset
Source: PlantVillage Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohitsingh1804/plantvillage)

ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
âœ… Trained CNN model (.h5 file)
âœ… GUI App (app.py)
âœ… Video demo of the application
âœ… Code for preprocessing, training, and evaluation
